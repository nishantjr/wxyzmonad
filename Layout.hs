data Layout a = forall l. (LayoutClass l a, Read (l a)) => Layout (l a)

-- | Every layout must be an instance of 'LayoutClass', which defines
-- the basic layout operations along with a sensible default for each.
--
-- All of the methods have default implementations, so there is no
-- minimal complete definition.  They do, however, have a dependency
-- structure by default; this is something to be aware of should you
-- choose to implement one of these methods.  Here is how a minimal
-- complete definition would look like if we did not provide any default
-- implementations:
--
-- * 'runLayout' || (('doLayout' || 'pureLayout') && 'emptyLayout')
--
-- * 'handleMessage' || 'pureMessage'
--
-- * 'description'
--
-- Note that any code which /uses/ 'LayoutClass' methods should only
-- ever call 'runLayout', 'handleMessage', and 'description'!  In
-- other words, the only calls to 'doLayout', 'pureMessage', and other
-- such methods should be from the default implementations of
-- 'runLayout', 'handleMessage', and so on.  This ensures that the
-- proper methods will be used, regardless of the particular methods
-- that any 'LayoutClass' instance chooses to define.
